# SQL Blocks Game

Welcome to SQL Blocks Game!

## Overview

SQL Blocks Game is an educational game inspired by Scratch, designed to help users learn and practice SQL queries through an interactive, block-based interface. Instead of writing code, players can create SQL queries by snapping together visual blocks, making it easy and fun to understand and build complex database queries.
By default a sample sql database is used, but players are also able to upload their own sql database and use it.
